# 📺 YouTube Next

## Overview

**YouTube Next** is a Chrome extension built using JavaScript and Chrome extension tools. It enhances the YouTube Shorts viewing experience by automating playback and switching to the next Short after a customizable timer. 

### 🌟 Inspiration

This project is inspired by a nightly routine shared between my mom and me. I often watch YouTube Shorts before going to sleep, leaving my phone in one place. My mom, who enjoys watching Shorts while washing utensils, usually picks it up afterward. We both noticed how inconvenient it is to manage playback without an autoplay feature or a customizable timer, leading to repeated content that can get annoying. **YouTube Next** was created to solve this problem, making our viewing experience more seamless and enjoyable.

### 🚀 Future Plans

In the future, I may extend this project by removing the Shorts feature from YouTube on the web, as it can sometimes become distracting during exam times and often leads to mindless scrolling.

## 🔧 Features

- ⏲️ **Autoplay Timer:** Set a custom duration to automatically switch to the next Short.
- 🎥 **Seamless Playback:** Enjoy uninterrupted viewing without the frustration of repeated content.
- 🛠️ **User-Friendly:** Simple interface to set your preferences and let the extension handle the rest.
